    "# Prompt Engineering and Probing with GPT3\n",
    "\n",
    "With GPT3, we can do a variety of tasks without the need of training a model. All we need to do is convert the task into an text generation task that follows a set of instructions called *prompts*. As an example, the task of sentiment classification can be designed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie!\n",
    "Sentiment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT3 model then completes the text above with the response **Positive**. The above prompt is an example of zero-shot learning, meaning, we are not providing any signal/direction that can guide the decision and merely rely on GPT's pretraining objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweet: I really liked the Spiderman movie!\n",
    "Sentiment: Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie!\n",
    "Sentiment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is an example of 1-shot learning, i.e., you are providing an labeled example of how the output should look and then ask GPT to complete the next example. When you use more than 1 labeled example, it is known as few-shot learning.  Generally, if you provide more examples in the prompt, it will make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will first need to register for an account at: https://platform.openai.com/ As a free trial, you will get $18 credits to make api calls to the GPT server. Once registered, you should go through the docs here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design to get more info on the capabilities of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can either do this homework using the free to use playground/chat interface of openai using the following links:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [https://platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)\n",
    "- [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you want to use the API to make automatic calls to open ai, we will need to follow the steps below:"

    "abstract =\"In the past three years, the so-called second wave of Virtual Reality (VR) has brought us a vast amount of new displays and input devices. Not only new hardware has entered the consumer market providing affordable pricing models but also completely new technologies are being designed and developed. Additionally new concepts for handling existing problems on the hardware and software side of the VR technology are constantly being introduced. This software and hardware development is mainly lead by enthusiasts interested in the domain of VR opposed to the established scientific community, which already partially makes use of the newly available technology. Besides Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), either cable-based or mobile, other devices like haptics devices, controllers, vests, omnidirectional treadmills, tracking technologies, as well as optical scanners for gesture-based interaction are gaining importance in the field of commodity VR. Most of these technologies are already precise and robust enough to be used for professional operation and scientific experiments. The topics discussed are the common issues with the new technologies including the approaches to solve them as for example motion-to-photon latency, barrel distortion, and low-persistence displays. Additionally an in-depth analysis of the available solutions expected to hit the market is provided. A taxonomy categorising the current developments with the chosen implementation approaches will be given.

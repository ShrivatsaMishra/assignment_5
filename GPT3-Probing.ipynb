    "# Prompt Engineering and Probing with GPT3\n",
    "\n",
    "For the extra-credit, we will be exploring the recent trend that has revolutionalized this field. With GPT3, we can do a variety of tasks without the need of training a model. All we need to do is convert the task into an text generation task that follows a set of instructions called *prompts*. As an example, the task of sentiment classification can be designed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie!\n",
    "Sentiment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT3 model then completes the text above with the response **Positive**. The above prompt is an example of zero-shot prediction, meaning, we are not providing any signal/direction that can guide the decision. We could also design the prompt as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweet: I really liked the Spiderman movie!\n",
    "Sentiment: Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie!\n",
    "Sentiment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is an example of 1-shot learning, i.e., you are providing an labeled example of how the output should look and then ask GPT3 to complete the next example. When you use more than 1 labeled example, it is known as few-shot learning.  The expectation is that, if you provide more examples in the prompt, it will make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this assignment, we will first need to register for an account at: https://beta.openai.com/ As a free trial, you will get $18 credits to make api calls to the GPT3 server. Once registered, you should go through the docs here: https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design to get more info on the capabilities of the model. You can then go directly interact with GPT3 in the playground: https://beta.openai.com/playground. For making these calls programmatically, we will do the following:"
